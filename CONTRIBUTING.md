# Contributing to Impulse

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Impulse is a [Databricks Labs](https://github.com/databrickslabs)
project and we welcome bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests from the community.

## Filing issues and feature requests

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/databrickslabs/impulse/issues) to track bugs and
feature requests. Issues labelled `help wanted` or `good first issue` are a great place to start.

For **major changes** such as a new solver, a silver/gold-layer schema change, or substantial
API changes, please open an issue first so we can discuss the approach. For **smaller changes**
(bug fixes, new aggregations or events, additional tests, doc improvements), feel free to send
a pull request directly.

## Development setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python** `>= 3.12, < 3.13` (the project pins this range in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml))
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** for dependency management
- **Java 17+** on your `PATH` (required by PySpark 4.0)
- **Git**

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/databrickslabs/impulse.git
cd impulse
make dev
```

`make dev` runs `uv sync --all-extras`, which creates a `.venv/` in the repo with all
runtime and development dependencies (pytest, ruff, black, plus pyspark/pandas/etc.
declared as `local-dev` extras for use outside Databricks runtimes).

### Project-scoped environment via direnv (recommended on macOS)

This repo ships an [`.envrc`](.envrc) that activates Java, the venv, and the
PySpark interpreter **only when you `cd` into the repo** — no pollution of your
global `PATH` or `JAVA_HOME`.

One-time setup:

```bash
brew install direnv openjdk@17               # JDK 17 stays keg-only — not on global PATH
echo 'eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc # or ~/.bashrc for bash
exec $SHELL                                  # reload so the hook is active
cd <path-to-this-repo> && direnv allow       # whitelist the .envrc
```

After that, every fresh terminal that enters this directory will auto-export:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `JAVA_HOME` | `$(brew --prefix openjdk@17)/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home` |
| `PATH` | `$JAVA_HOME/bin` prepended |
| Python venv | `.venv/` activated |
| `PYSPARK_PYTHON` / `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON` | `.venv/bin/python` (worker = driver) |

Verify with `java -version` (should show OpenJDK 17) and `which python` (should
point inside `.venv/`). Outside the repo, both should fall back to whatever
your system default is — direnv unloads automatically.

> If you can't use direnv, the `.envrc` is a plain shell script — `source .envrc`
> works as a manual alternative inside a single shell session.

## Running tests

```bash
make test                             # full suite with coverage
uv run pytest tests/path/to/test.py   # a single test file
```

Notes specific to Impulse:

- [tests/conftest.py](tests/conftest.py) provisions a session-scoped local Spark session with
  Delta enabled and creates the `silver`, `silver_narrow_db`, `silver_key_value_store`, and
  `gold` schemas. You don't need a Databricks workspace to run the unit tests.
- Spark warehouse output is written to `spark-warehouse/` (gitignored).
- **LakeVision schema tests** (`tests/mda_query_engine/perception/unit/`) are pure-Python introspection of
  `StructType` definitions and dataclass validators — no JVM required. A local
  [`tests/mda_query_engine/perception/unit/conftest.py`](tests/mda_query_engine/perception/unit/conftest.py) overrides the
  inherited Spark autouse fixtures with no-ops, so these tests run in ~30 ms without Java.
  Future LakeVision integration tests should live in `tests/mda_query_engine/perception/integration/` which
  will inherit the real Spark fixtures.

## Code style

We use **black** for formatting and **ruff** for linting. Both are configured in
[pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) (line length 99, target Python 3.12).

To format your code and apply ruff auto-fixes:

```bash
make fmt
```

To check formatting and lint without modifying files (what CI runs):

```bash
make lint
```

CI ([`.github/workflows/acceptance.yml`](.github/workflows/acceptance.yml)) runs `make lint`
on every pull request, so please run `make fmt` before pushing to avoid CI failures.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes; add or update tests covering the new behavior.
3. Run `make fmt` and `make test` locally.
4. Open a pull request. The [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md) walks you through
   the summary, changes, and test plan.
5. CI must pass (format, lint, tests). A maintainer will review the PR.

## Definition of done

- [ ] New or changed behavior is covered by tests
- [ ] `make lint` and `make test` pass locally
- [ ] Public APIs have NumPy-style docstrings (see ruff config in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml))
- [ ] User-facing changes are reflected in [README.md](README.md) and/or `docs/impulse/`
- [ ] PR description follows the [template](.github/pull_request_template.md)

## Project support

Impulse is a Databricks Labs project provided AS-IS, without SLAs. See the
[Project Support](README.md#project-support) section of the README for details. File issues on
GitHub and we'll review them as time permits.
